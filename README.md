## 💡 Development Inspiration  

My inspiration for CheetahType came from my realization of how much **typing skills impact daily workflow**.  

For **several months**, I committed to practice typing **15 minutes every day**. My WPM **skyrocketed from 35 to 165**.  
I started with beginner typing applications, then moved on to **accuracy-focused practice**, and eventually found myself competing in **multiplayer typing races**.  

The **average typist** spends about **8-12 minutes** on these platforms—whether completing **short 15-second sequences** or engaging in full typing races.  

### ❌ The Problem  
After trying just about every **typing Application that exists**, I was **never satisfied**. Here’s why:  

1. 🖥️ **Terrible UI** – Outdated designs and clunky interfaces  
2. 📢 **Overloaded with Ads** – Ads disrupt the user experience and slow everything down  
3. 🤖 **Bot-Filled Lobbies** – Matches felt rigged and uncompetitive  
4. ⏳ **Slow Matchmaking** – Waiting over a minute just to start a game  

These **issues take up valuable time** during a user’s short, focused typing session.  
So, I thought to myself...

### **Fine, I'll do it myself.**
